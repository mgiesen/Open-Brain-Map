# Concept 🔨

Conceived as a personal hobby project, OpenBrainMap aims to document and visualize knowledge networks. The primary focus lies in the semantic linkage of information, enhancing topic categorization and providing a comprehensive overview of complex subjects.

The tool also embraces the significance of YouTube as a learning platform, allowing each node to be supplemented with a relevant YouTube link.

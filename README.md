## Concept and Motivation 🔨

Crafted as a personal hobby project, `Open-Brain-Map` aims to document and visualize knowledge networks. The primary focus lies in the semantic linkage of information, enhancing topic categorization and providing a comprehensive overview of complex subjects.

The tool also embraces the significance of YouTube as a learning platform, allowing each node to be supplemented with a relevant YouTube link. With the general link you can refer to any kind of ressource you want to provide to the viewer.
